                    <h1>Astrology</h1>
                    <p> Astrology plays a significant role in a Nepali person’s life especially during important transitions in life like marriage, having children, moving to a new house, working on a new business etc. The moment a child is born in Nepal, the exact time of birth is noted and given to the astrologer, who according to the position of the different planets in the solar system at that precise moment prepares a Cheena (horoscope). 

                        Astrologers are consulted on various occasions like rice feeding, sacred thread and weddings. Almost all religious festivals in Nepal are governed by astrological readings.
                        
                        Tika during Dashain, Bhai Tika during Tihar, etc are occasions when the astrologers determine the auspicious hours for these festivities to take place. They also forecast the solar and lunar eclipses and their impact on people. </p>
